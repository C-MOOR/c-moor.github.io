      <description>These exercises were used as preparation for participants in the 2018 Practical Genomics workshop. More information and registration for future workshops can be found at JHU Genomics.
Prerequisites  Install R (version 3.4.3 or higher) and RStudio (version 1.1.423 or higher). Some familiarity with basic R commands. Prior to completing these assignments, participants were asked to complete the Swirl &amp;ldquo;R Programming: The basics of programming in R&amp;rdquo; exercises.

More information and registration for future workshops can be found at JHU Genomics.\nPrerequisites  Install R (version 3.4.3 or higher) and RStudio (version 1.1.423 or higher). Some familiarity with basic R commands. Prior to completing these assignments, participants were asked to complete the Swirl \u0026ldquo;R Programming: The basics of programming in R\u0026rdquo; exercises. Note: Participants were primarily graduate students and postdoctoral fellows studying biology, so some biological concepts are not explained.
